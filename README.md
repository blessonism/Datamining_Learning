# Datamining_Learning

## Overview

This repository is a collection of various data mining exercises and projects that aim to provide hands-on experience with different data mining techniques and tools. The projects cover a wide range of topics including decision trees, affinity analysis, Naive Bayes for text classification, movie recommendation systems, and more. The code is implemented in Python and Scala, with Jupyter notebooks provided for interactive exploration.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each focusing on a specific data mining technique or project. Below is a brief description of each directory:

- **亲和性分析 (Affinity Analysis)**: This directory contains code and data for affinity analysis, which is used to identify patterns or associations between different items in a dataset.
- **决策树 (Decision Tree)**: Implementation of decision tree algorithms, a popular method for classification and regression tasks.
- **朴素贝叶斯twitter文本 (Naive Bayes for Twitter Text)**: A project focused on text classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm, particularly applied to Twitter data.
- **欧式距离电离层 (Euclidean Distance for Ionosphere Data)**: An exploration of distance metrics, particularly Euclidean distance, applied to ionosphere data for classification.
- **电影亲和性分析 (Movie Affinity Analysis)**: A specific case study applying affinity analysis techniques to movie data, possibly to build a recommendation system.
- **基于 SparkSQL 的电影分析项目实战 (Movie Analysis using SparkSQL)**: A practical project that leverages SparkSQL for large-scale movie data analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code in this repository, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6+)
- Scala (version 2.12+)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Apache Spark
- Required Python libraries

## Usage

Each project directory contains its own set of instructions and code files. You can navigate to any of these directories and run the scripts or notebooks as needed. For example, to run the decision tree project, go to the `决策树` directory and open the relevant Jupyter notebook.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have suggestions for new data mining techniques to explore or improvements to the existing code, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
